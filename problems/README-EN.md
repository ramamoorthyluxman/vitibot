Vitibot - Robotics Development Engineer Technical Test
Some rules:

Timing: you have no time limit

The exercises are independent; you are asked to create a workspace for each exercise

Programming language: C++

Organize your workspace with the folders src, include, and bin, and use CMake to compile your project (CMakeLists.txt)

Use version control in your development (Git) and share the project with us with the ./git folder so that we can verify your development process (branches, commit history, etc.)

To test your program, you will use the inputX.txt files as stdin input like this:
./main < input1.txt, for example.

You can also read the file passed as a parameter like this:
./main input1.txt, for example.

We spare you the management of possible access rights errors or non-existent files.

The output will be on stdout.
